## Today's content

Introduction to Git and Github

Commands in RStudio and the terminal

Installation and setup

## In a nutshell

**Git**

*A distributed version control system*

- Version control
  - Log changes during our ongoing work
  - Create snapshots of the full project
- Distributed
  - Split a project into parallel versions (*branches*), each containing the complete project
  - Work on smaller individual problems and merge versions into the main *branch*
<br>

**Github**

*A cloud-based platform for version control and collaboration*

- Cloud-based
  - Files are stored online and often made publicly available
- Collaboration
  - Projects can be split over several workers

## Some historical background

Both Git and Github were developed as technical software development tools

<br>

Git was created in the 2000s as part of Linux development

Github was started in 2007 and is owned by Microsoft since 2018

<br>

The official help information can often be quite obtuse (*imo*)

But since Git is used in many less technical fields there are lots of resources available

## Terminology

- *Staging.* Marking a file for the next commit
- *Commit.* Creating a time-stamp of the current version
- *Branch.* A version of the project

- *Clone.* Creating a local version of a project
- *Fork.* Creating a personal version of a Github project
- *Pull.* Moving the current online (Github) version to the local branch
- *Push.* Moving the current local version to the online (Github) version

## Working in Git

We can work in Git using several interfaces

**The command line (or Terminal)**

Write *Git commands* directly in the terminal

**RStudio**

A git-connected project will have a specific *Git* tab

Point-and-click-interface to stage, commit, push

There are also R packages to run Git commands

**Specific Git interfaces**

Git GUI - included in the Git for Windows installation

Github Desktop

VS Code

GitKraken - ([gitkraken.com/](https://www.gitkraken.com/))

## Basic Git work. Local

**Initializing**

Linking a folder to Git

Can be automatically selected when starting an R project

```{r, eval=F}
> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Project folder/.git/
```

<div class="fragment fade-in">
**Status**

See the current status

```{r, eval=F}
> git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Test-file.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
</div>

##

**Staging**

Setting files where changes should be tracked

Marking in the Git tab in RStudio

```{r, eval=F}
> git add .
```

<div class="fragment fade-in">
**Committing**

Creating a time-stamped version (a *commit*)

Using the Commit button in RStudio

```{r, eval=F}
> git commit -m "Add test-file"
[main (root-commit) 474a28e] Add test-file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 Test-file.txt
```
</div>

##

**View history**

History button in the Git tab in RStudio

```{r, eval=F}
> git log
commit 474a28e46ef88ac01b1cfa3c1f15ead33267c7da (HEAD -> main)
Author: adamflr <flr.adam@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 1 15:24:44 2024 +0200

    Add test-file
```

## Branches

**Create a new branch**

*New branch* button in Git tab in RStudio

```{r, eval=F}
> git checkout -b new-branch
Switched to a new branch 'new-branch'
```

<div class="fragment fade-in">
Branch can be changed in the Git tab (drop menu to the right) or with `checkout`

```{r, eval=F}
> git checkout main
> git checkout new-branch
```

Changes can be staged and committed to the new branch as usual
</div>

##

**Merging branches**

Changes in a branch can be merged into another by going to the target branch and using merge

```{r, eval=F}
> git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'

> git merge new-branch
Updating 474a28e..463c8ae
Fast-forward
 File in a new branch.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 File in a new branch.txt
```

## Basic Git work. Global

If a local Git project is linked to an online Git repository one can pull (get the current online version) and push (change the online version to the current local version)

**Pull**

Pull button in the Git tab in RStudio

```{r, eval=F}
> git pull
Already up to date.
```

<div class="fragment fade-in">
**Push**

Push button in the Git tab in RStudio

```{r, eval=F}
> git push

Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.

```
</div>

##

**Cloning**

Copies an entire Github repository to a local folder

*File > New Project > Version Control > Git* in RStudio

```{r, eval=F}
> git clone git@github.com:adamflr/Presentations.git
Cloning into 'Presentations'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 384, done.

```


## Installation and startup

1. Installing R
2. Installing RStudio
3. Installing Git [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
4. Checking so that Git is reachable from RStudio
5. Registering a Github account
6. Linking the local machine to Github using an SSH key
7. Starting a new Github repository
8. Starting an RStudio project linked to that repository

These instructions follow the steps on a Windows system

## 3. Installing Git

1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
2. Identify the download page
3. Choose according to operating system and download the installer
4. Run the installer. Pick the default options
5. Open *Git Bash* on the Start menu and run `git --version`

If successful the result should be the version number of the Git installation

## 4. Checking the Git-RStudio connection

1. Open RStudio and go to *Tools > Global Options...*
2. Find the *Git/SVN* settings and check so that there is a path under *Git executable*
3. Go to *File > New project...*, select *New directory*, then *New project*, pick a name and a folder on the local drive. Check the *Create a Git repository* button and click *Create project*
4. In the new project, look for the *Git* tab, likely in the same window as *History* and *Environment*

At this point one can do staging, branching and commits

5. Create a new file and save it in the project. It will show up in the Git tab
6. Check the box under *Staged* and click *Commit*
7. Write an comment in the comment box and click *Commit*
8. Check *History* the see the commit

## 5. Register a Github account

Go to github.com and sign up

## 6. Link the local machine to Github

Two types of protocols possible: SSH and HTTPS

This suggestion is for SSH, since I find it a bit easier in RStudio

1. Go back to RStudio and go to *Tools > Global Options...*
2. Under Git/SVN click *Create SSH key* and then *Create* and *OK*
3. Click *View public key* and copy the text
4. Go to Github. Click the icon on the top right and go to *Settings*
5. Find *SSH and GPG keys* in the list to the left
6. Click *New SSH key*. Give a suitable title (like *work-2024*) and paste the SSH key from RStudio in the area for *Key*

## 7 & 8. Start a repository and an RStudio project

Finally a Github repository needs to be linked to an RStudio project

The easiest way is to create an empty repository and start a new project

1. Go to the Github start page
2. Start a new repository (button on top left) and give it some name (like *test-project*). Click *Create repository*
3. Copy the SSH link from the next page
4. Go to RStudio and *File > New Project...*
5. Select *Version control* and *Git.* Paste the SSH link under *Repository URL*. Place the new project somewhere on the local drive (usually C:)
6. A project window will open. Find the Git tab. Stage the files and commit. The click *Push*. Write *yes* if there is a question prompt.
7. Update the Github page of the repository and check if the pushed files appear

## Best Practices

Tips for Effective Use

-   **Commit Often**: Make frequent commits with meaningful messages.
-   **Branching Strategy**: Use branches for features, fixes, and experiments.
-   **Code Reviews**: Regularly review code via pull requests.
-   **Documentation**: Maintain good documentation for your projects.
-   **Backup**: Regularly push changes to remote repositories.
